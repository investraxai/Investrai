# Backend Directory

This directory will contain all backend-related code when the application is connected to a real backend.

Currently, the application uses mock data located at `src/lib/mock-data.ts`, but this folder structure is prepared for future integration with:

- API services
- Authentication services
- Database models
- Server-side utilities
- Environment configurations

## Potential Future Implementation

When implementing a real backend, consider:

1. API service implementations 
2. Data fetching layers
3. Authentication and authorization
4. Real-time data connections
5. Server-side rendering
